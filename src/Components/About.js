            Homework, or a homework assignment, is a set of tasks assigned to
            students by their teachers to be completed outside the classroom.
            Common homework assignments may include required reading, a writing
            or typing project, mathematical exercises to be completed,
            information to be reviewed before a test, or other skills to be
            practiced. The effects of homework are debated. Generally speaking,
